## Introduction 
In electrical wiring, a light switch is a switch most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets.
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.
The push-button light switch has two buttons: one that closes the contacts and one that opens the contacts.


## Research
A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a solid state light source that emits light by the electroluminescence effect. LEDs utilize the radiative recombination process of electrons and holes to generate light through photon emission. Electrons and holes are pumped into the space charge region in multiple quantum wells under forward bias and they recombine to emit light.
The increasing demand for light emitting diodes (LEDs) has been driven by a number of application categories, including display backlighting, communications, medical services, signage, and general illumination.

## Cost and Features and Timeline

The LED lamp market is projected to grow from $75.8 billion in 2020 and increasing to $160 billion in 2026.
