## Introduction 
In electrical wiring, a light switch is a switch most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets.
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.
The push-button light switch has two buttons: one that closes the contacts and one that opens the contacts.


## Research
A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a solid state light source that emits light by the electroluminescence effect. LEDs utilize the radiative recombination process of electrons and holes to generate light through photon emission. Electrons and holes are pumped into the space charge region in multiple quantum wells under forward bias and they recombine to emit light.
The increasing demand for light emitting diodes (LEDs) has been driven by a number of application categories, including display backlighting, communications, medical services, signage, and general illumination.

## Cost and Features and Timeline

The LED lamp market is projected to grow from $75.8 billion in 2020 and increasing to $160 billion in 2026.
LEDs come to full brightness immediately with no warm-up delay. Frequent switching on and off does not reduce life expectancy as with fluorescent lighting.
## SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTHS 
A decade back, who would have thought that technology will enable controlling light bulbs with the help of a smartphone! Using LED smart lighting technology, bulbs can connect to a smart device using wireless technology. Motion sensors can also be set up on these lights to switch them on or off based on a person’s proximity to the sensor. Such innovations give the user complete control of their lighting system and this is one of the major benefits of LED smart lights. Another major benefit of LED smart lighting technology is reduced electricity consumption. Due to the increased sustainability, smart LED lights manufacturers can expect greater government incentives to support their operations. Although this is a breakthrough innovation, the setup of these smart bulbs is as simple as it can get. Once the bulb gets inserted into the light source, all it takes is to download an appropriate app and set up the wireless connectivity, making it simple and easy to use.
## WEAKNESSES
Since this technology is relatively new, not a lot of people are aware of these bulbs. Furthermore, some of the top companies producing LED smart lights also deal with conventional bulbs, making this a tough market to battle against.  As such, smart lighting companies must focus more on the tech-savvy population, especially millennials who have an affinity towards such innovations. Moreover, as the pricing of these bulbs is on the higher side, there are greater chances of reluctance from customers to buy this product. Another important drawback of an LED smart bulb is that not all of these bulbs follow the same setup process. While most models use wireless technology to connect, some of them may require additional hubs or switches to function as expected. Such complicated installation processes make it even more difficult to make such technology mainstream.
## OPPORTUNITIES
The rising government incentives for energy-saving products are an opportunity for LED smart lighting companies to expand their business operations by making more products available to the market. Factors such as rapid urbanization and the rising need for mobility could also largely fuel the growth of this industry. Furthermore, companies in the sector can also plan to move beyond catering to domestic needs and expand at an industrial or organizational scale. As a greater number of companies are trying to incorporate sustainable practices and the benefits of longer-lasting bulbs are a key incentive to attract corporate clients.
## THREATS 
The lighting industry is characterized by cut-throat competition, with market players offering similar products and aiming to be leaders in the smart lighting segment. However, traditional bulbs continue to dominate the market with only a small population of buyers for smart bulbs currently. Moreover, the traditional lighting options are much cheaper than the smart lighting solutions, making it a more favored segment among buyers. Another major barrier is the complications involved in the setup and usage of smart bulbs. Due to the relatively complex procedures involved, buyers may choose to go with the traditional options available.


# 4W's and 1'H
## Who:  
In 1962, Nick Holonyak Jr. and his team at GE invented the Light Emitting Diode.
## What:
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. While LED lights are almost everywhere today — from bridges to headlights to keychain flashlights that are brighter than the sun.
## When:
In 1962, Nick Holonyak, Jr invented the first LED that produced visible, red light while working at General Electric.
## Where:
The high efficiency and directional nature of LEDs makes them ideal for many industrial uses. LEDs are increasingly common in street lights, parking garage lighting, walkway and other outdoor area lighting, refrigerated case lighting, modular lighting, and task lighting.
## How:
The light-emitting diode simply, we know as a diode. When the diode is forward biased, then the electrons & holes are moving fast across the junction and they are combined constantly, removing one another out. Soon after the electrons are moving from the n-type to the p-type silicon, it combines with the holes, then it disappears. Hence it makes the complete atom & more stable and it gives the little burst of energy in the form of a tiny packet or photon of light.
