# M2-Embedded_Toggle-LED's
Toggle LED's using push button switch.

In electrical wiring, a light switch is a switch most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets.
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.
The push-button light switch has two buttons: one that closes the contacts and one that opens the contacts.
